Functions Of App
Three unique methods for grouping the data should be provided by the application:


Sort tickets into groups according to their status, such as "Open," "In Progress," "Closed," or any other pertinent state.

By User: Sort tickets based on the designated user. This makes it simple to monitor each person's workload and spot possible bottlenecks.

Sort tickets into groups according to their priority, for example, "Urgent," "High," "Medium," "Low," or "No priority." This guarantees that important jobs are attended to right away.

Also, users ought to have two options for sorting the tickets that are displayed:

Priority: Sort tickets into lower and lower priority groups. This guarantees that important jobs are visible at the top of the list and gives them priority.

The priority levels for the tickets should be clearly indicated : 

Urgent (Priority level 4):  to signify immediate attention required.

High (Priority level 3): tasks that should be addressed promptly.

Medium (Priority level 2): tasks with moderate importance.

Low (Priority level 1): tasks that can be addressed with lower urgency.

No priority (Priority level 0):  tasks without any specific priority assigned.
